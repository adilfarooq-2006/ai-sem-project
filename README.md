# Operation Indus Relief: AI Disaster Response System

## Overview
This project is a Final Term AI application that simulates flood relief operations in Punjab, Pakistan. It utilizes **Genetic Algorithms** for safe pathfinding and **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)** for intelligent resource allocation.

## Features
- **Dynamic Simulation:** Simulates flood spread based on city elevation data.
- **Genetic Navigation:** Finds routes that balance speed vs. safety.
- **CSP Logistics:** Automatically assigns Trucks, Drones, or Helicopters based on road conditions and cargo weight.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Generates `mission_map.html` showing the rescue path and flood zones.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install folium
